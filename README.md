#### DebolinaGhosh_102103365

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the diabetes dataset from scikit-learn. It consists of ten baseline variables, age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements obtained for each of n=442 diabetes patients, as well as the response of interest, a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

## Setup

The following Python libraries are required to run the code:

- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- tabulate

## Files
clustering.ipynb: Python script containing the code for comparing different clustering algorithms.
README.md: Markdown file providing information about the project.

## Results
The results of the clustering algorithms comparison are displayed in tabular format in the clustering file.
